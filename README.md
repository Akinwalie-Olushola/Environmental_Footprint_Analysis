# 📊 Project Title: Environmental_Footprint_Analysis

## Overview
This project is an environmental footprint analysis of an international accounting firm operating out of 8 locations in 4 countries. 
Annual data of operational and value chain (scope 3) emissions was collected through a Google Form survey to uncover insights and answer important business questions between the year 2020 and 2025.

## The workflow includes:

Data collection via Google Forms

Data cleaning and transformation in Microsoft Excel

Visualization and storytelling in Looker Studio

Final insights and actionable recommendations

   - Timeframe : 2020-2025

##🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  
   Key steps included:
   
    - Removing duplicates 
    
    - Creating calculated fields such as:
        
         Scope 1,2&3 emissions(tCO2e)
         
         Total emissions(tC02e)
          
         Net emissions (tCO2e)
    -  Standardizing categorical responses
    
    -  Preparing the dataset for visualization


##📈 **Dashboard & Visualizations**
  The interactive dashboard was built in Looker Studio and includes:
    
    -  Summary metrics
    -  Trend analysis
    -  Segmentation breakdowns
    -  Key performance indicators
    -  Filters for deeper exploration.

##🔍**Key Insights & 🧭 Recommendations**
   -  insight 1:   There was no significant deduction in total emission over the 6 year period, 2022 and 2023 only experienced a net negative emission because carbon offset purchased was a little higher.

   -  insight 2:   Scope 2 contribute the highest to total emission.

   -  insight 3:   Air transportation contribute the most to scope 3 emissions (tC02e),a total of 78.25% 

       These insights helped shape the final recommendations.

        Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

     - Recommendation 1: There is a need to set a medium-term emissions reduction target,rather than a yearly change comparison. 

     - Recommendation 2: Implement a consistent energy monitoring framework.

     - Recommendation 3: sustainable procurement and logistics policy will help reduce scope 3 emissions (tC02e).

   Full recommendations are available in the PDF.
